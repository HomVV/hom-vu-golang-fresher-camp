Primary key in DB:
  - Constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table
  - Must contain unique values
  - A primary key column mustn't contain Null value
  - Each table should have a primary key and can have only one primary key
Primary key auto increase:
  - Make sure that no component of the primary key of a base table should be allowed to accept NULL values
  - Auto generate primary key when add new record on a table in DB
Primary key with more than 2 fields(Composite Keys):
  - It can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table when the columns are combined uniqueness of a row is guaranteed
  - When it is taken individually it does not guarantee uniqueness
  - It can also be understood as a primary key made by the combination of two or more attributes to uniquely identify every row in a table.
  - The table has composite key is often generated by some tables with many-many relationship
